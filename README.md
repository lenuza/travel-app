## Travel App
The Travel app is the final project of the Udacity frontend nanodegree course. It will receive a location and date as input from the client and will pull information from different APIs, to show the weather at the desired location.


## Tools
The app will use Node.js and Express.js to set a webserver and routing. It will use also Webpack, Sass and Google Workbox.

## Get Up and Running
